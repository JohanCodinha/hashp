# Hashp

Hashp is a better `prn` for debugging Clojure code. Inspired by
projects like [Spyscope][], Hashp (ab)uses data readers to make it
easier to get useful debugging data sent to STDOUT.

## Usage

Once installed, you can add `#p` in front of any form you wish to
print:

```clojure
(ns example.core)

(defn mean [xs]
  (/ (double #p (reduce + xs)) #p (count xs)))
```

It's faster to type than `(prn ...)`, returns the original result, and
produces more useful output by printing the original form, function
and line number:

```
user=> (mean [1 4 5 2])
#p[example.core/mean:4] (reduce + xs) => 12
#p[example.core/mean:4] (count xs) => 4
3.0
```

## Install
